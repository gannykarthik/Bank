Bank - Modern Banking Dashboard

This project is a complete, single-page web application that simulates a modern banking dashboard. It is built entirely with client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and is designed to be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

The application features a sleek, dark-mode interface and provides a comprehensive overview of a user's financial status, including account balances, transaction history, and spending analysis.

Key Features

Sleek Dark Mode UI: A professional and modern interface that's easy on the eyes.

Interactive Dashboard: At-a-glance cards for checking and savings accounts.

Transaction History: A clear, scrollable list of recent transactions, color-coded for income and expenses.

Functional Money Transfer: An intuitive pop-up modal for transferring funds between accounts, complete with validation and success feedback.

Spending Analysis: A doughnut chart powered by Chart.js to visualize spending habits by category.

Fully Responsive: The layout adapts perfectly to both desktop and mobile screens.

Zero Dependencies: Runs directly in the browser with no need for a server or installation.

Tech Stack

This application is built with core web technologies, demonstrating a clean separation of concerns within a single file:

HTML5: For the semantic structure of the application.

CSS3 / Tailwind CSS: For modern styling, layout, and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all application logic, including data management, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

Chart.js: For creating the interactive spending analysis chart.

How to Run

Since this is a standalone, client-side application, running it is very simple:

Ensure you have the bank_app.html file on your local machine.

Double-click the bank.html file.

It will open directly in your default web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge), and the application will be fully functional.

There is no need for a web server, build steps, or any installations.
